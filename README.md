# 📋 Angular Form & Table App
### Component-Based Data Entry and Display (Angular)

An **Angular single-page application** demonstrating **component interaction, form handling, and dynamic data display** using a clean, component-driven architecture.

This project focuses on core Angular concepts such as **data binding**, **component communication**, and **structured UI composition**, rather than visual complexity.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The application allows users to:
- enter data through a form component,
- submit and validate that data,
- and display it dynamically inside a table component.

The logic is split between clearly defined components, making the application easy to understand, test, and extend.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Form-based data entry (`FormElementComponent`)
- ✅ Dynamic table rendering (`TableElementComponent`)
- ✅ Component-based Angular architecture
- ✅ Angular routing setup
- ✅ TypeScript-driven state handling
- ✅ Unit test scaffolding for components
